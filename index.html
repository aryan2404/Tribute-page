            <h3>
                Abul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born to Jainulabdeen, a boat owner and Imam, and Ashiamma, a
                housewife. Kalam had four brothers and a sister, all elder to him.
                Although Kalam’s ancestors had been wealthy traders, the family had descended into difficult times and
                Kalam used to sell newspapers as a child to add-on to his family’s modest income.
                Kalam studied at a school in Ramanathapuram and acquired a degree in Physics from Saint Joseph’s
                College, Tiruchirappalli. In 1955, he went to the Madras Institute of Technology to pursue aerospace
                engineering. His dream of becoming a fighter pilot was thwarted when he missed the qualifier by a narrow
                margin. He was ranked ninth but only 8 positions were available with the IAF.
                After that, he got a job as a scientist at the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence
                Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). He also worked under eminent scientist Vikram Sarabhai.
                Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 1969. At ISRO, he was the
                Project Director of the satellite launch vehicle (SLV) that successfully deployed the satellite Rohini
                into orbit in 1980. It was India’s first SLV.
                Kalam also worked to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV).
                He was also the director of two projects, Project Valiant and Project Devil for developing ballistic
                missiles from the SLV technology. His research and leadership led him to the directorship of an advanced
                missile development programme.
                When R Venkataraman was the Defence Minister, Kalam was appointed the chief executive of the Integrated
                Guided Missile Development Programme that was a project aimed at developing a fleet of missiles.
                He was known as the ‘Missile Man of India’ for his work in the development of ballistic missile
                technology.
                From 1992 to 1999, Kalam was the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of the
                DRDO. Kalam was the Chief Project Coordinator during the Pokhran II tests. During this time, Kalam
                became India’s best-known scientist.
                In 2002, Abdul Kalam was elected the 11th President of India. He had won by a huge margin. He was the
                first scientist to become India’s President and incidentally the first bachelor too.
                Kalam’s term as the president which lasted the full term till 2007 was beneficial for the office of the
                president itself. He came to be called the People’s President. His popularity soared among the people,
                especially school children. He visited many parts of the country and his speeches became popular for
                their motivational content.
                Despite pressure from the people to have him stand for a second term, he decided not to contest.
                After the presidency, Kalam became a visiting professor at the IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Shillong, IIM Indore,
                the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Anna University, etc.
                Abdul Kalam died of a cardiac arrest while giving a lecture at the IIM Shillong on 27 July 2015. There
                was widespread grief expressed at his passing away with the government of India declaring a 7-day state
                mourning. The governments of various other countries as well as the United Nations expressed their
                grief.
                He was laid to rest with full state honours at his native Rameswaram.
                Abdul Kalam was a man of integrity who was known for his honesty. He left no personal wealth after his
                death barring a few personal possessions which included his books, laptop, etc.
                He was knowledgeable in the teachings of various religions and had become a symbol of inter-faith
                dialogue.
                <br>
                Dr. Kalam took up academic pursuit as Professor, Technology & Societal Transformation at Anna
                University, Chennai from November 2001 and was involved in teaching and research tasks. Above all he
                took up a mission to ignite the young minds for national development by meeting high school students
                across the country.

                In his literary pursuit four of Dr. Kalam's books - "Wings of Fire", "India 2020 - A Vision for the New
                Millennium", "My journey" and "Ignited Minds - Unleashing the power within India" have become household
                names in India and among the Indian nationals abroad. These books have been translated in many Indian
                languages.

                Dr. Kalam is one of the most distinguished scientists of India with the unique honour of receiving
                honorary doctorates from 30 universities and institutions. He has been awarded the coveted civilian
                awards - Padma Bhushan (1981) and Padma Vibhushan (1990) and the highest civilian award Bharat Ratna
                (1997). He is a recipient of several other awards and Fellow of many professional institutions.

                Dr. Kalam became the 11th President of India on 25th July 2002. His focus is on transforming India into
                a developed nation by 2020.
